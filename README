Working with the source code repository
---------------------------------------

dleyna-server can be downloaded, compiled and installed as
follows:

   Clone repository
     # git clone git://github.com/01org/dleyna-server.git
     # cd dleyna-server

   Configure and build
     # ./autoreconf -i
     # ./configure
     # make

   Final installation
     # sudo make install

These instructions are suitable for users who simply want to install
and run dleyna-server.  However, developers wishing to contribute
to the project should follow a separate "Configure and build" step.

   Configure and build
     # ./bootstrap-configure
     # make

The script "bootstrap-configure" cleans the repository, calls
autreconf and then invokes configure with proper settings for
development.  These settings include the enabling of
maintainer mode and debugging.

Developers can remove autogenerated files with the following command

     # make maintainer-clean
